# Omni-Wheel-Robot

## Arduino Omni Wheel Robot

### Overview

This repository contains the code for an Arduino-based Omni Wheel Robot equipped with an L293D Motor Shield and an HC-05 Bluetooth module. The robot is designed for precise and omnidirectional movement, making it an ideal platform for experimentation and educational purposes.

### Features

Omnidirectional Movement: The omni wheels allow the robot to move seamlessly in any direction, making it highly manoeuvrable.
**Motor Control:** The L293D Motor Shield provides efficient control over the robot's motors, enabling precise movement and speed regulation.
**Bluetooth Connectivity:** The integrated HC-05 Bluetooth module allows wireless communication with the robot, opening up possibilities for remote control and sensor integration.

### Getting Started

1. Hardware Setup: Connect the motors to the L293D Motor Shield and ensure the Omni wheels are correctly configured.
2. **Bluetooth Configuration:** Pair your device with the HC-05 module and obtain the necessary information for communication.
3. **Upload the Code:** Use the Arduino IDE to upload the provided code to your Arduino board.

### Usage

1. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
2. Power up the robot and ensure the Bluetooth module is connected.
3. Use a Bluetooth-enabled device to establish a connection and control the robot.
